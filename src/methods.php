                    We design all our systems to mimic how nature builds resilient ecosystems. The more interactions between different types of organisms, i.e. diversity, the more efficient and stable the system will be. This is what holistic management and regenerative agriculture is all about.

                    The sheep that we lend from our Partner Mina Kandi, are kept in a compact flock and moved daily across the pasture using electric fencing to mimic their behaviour in the wild protecting themselves from predators. As competition for food is high and they litter their food with the excrements they are constantly moving. In this system the grass is heavily grazed, trampled and manured on during one day, and then allowed to fully recover before the sheep come back to the same spot. This is how all great plains in the world have functioned for thousands of years and it happens to be one of the most efficient ways to bring atmospheric CO2 into the soil as stable carbon.<br>
                    However, nature is even more marvelous than this. Additionally, because of competition within the herd, individual animals cannot afford to pick and choose which plants to eat, they simply have to eat whatever they find before someone else eats it. This gives the animals a much broader diet, producing healthier animals and tastier meat while at the same time avoiding overgrazing popular plants and managing weeds that typically proliferate in traditional grazing systems.

            To increase the number of interactions we are integrating layer hens into this system. Our layer hens follow the sheep in a similar manner with 3-4 days delay so that they reach the sheep paddocks around the time flylarvea and other insects hatch in the sheep manure, thus providing an excellent source of animal protein. The hens are experts at distributing manure, managing pests, and adding fertility to the land, fertility that can be used in subsequent crops. In addition, the hens pick up many important vitamins and minerals not found in their conventional feed from grazing our multi species pasture which is why our eggs have such high quality and great taste.

            Regenerating nature is and should be rewarding!
